# Droid PreToolUse guard for interactive approval questions during away mode.
#
# `.factory/settings.json` invokes this command only for Droid's exact AskUser
# tool.  While the durable away flag exists, the call is denied rather than
# answered, and every attempted question is first filed with the owner that
# already holds its decision.  Removing the flag through bin/fm-afk-return.sh
# restores AskUser with no saved answer or widened authority.
#
# OWNERSHIP COMES FROM THE CALLER, NEVER FROM PROSE.
# Native AskUser exposes one freeform questionnaire string and no typed owner
# field, so each numbered question block must carry its own binding line:
#
#   [firstmate-decision origin=<origin-slug> key=<decision-key> state=existing]
#   [firstmate-decision origin=<origin-slug> key=derive state=unseeded]
#
# `[topic]` is descriptive UI text and is never an owner, so a questionnaire may
# combine several origins and may omit topics entirely.  A block whose binding is
# missing or malformed is REJECTED with an error naming the missing requirement:
# it is never filed by inference from a topic, session, working directory, or
# question text, and never written to a synthetic ledger.  `key=derive` asks the
# guard for a stable identity computed from the origin, the question text, and
# the ordered option texts, so an exact replay keeps one identity while a
# substantively different question receives another.
#
# Filing itself belongs to bin/fm-decision-hold.sh, which owns the ordered
# resolution across the captain-hold and status-decision owners and their
# existing close paths.  This guard parses, validates, and denies; it creates no
# question queue, no parallel ledger, and no closing mechanism.  It is inert in
# linked task worktrees and non-Firstmate repositories through the shared
# primary-scope predicate.
#
# Usage:
#   <Droid AskUser PreToolUse JSON on stdin> | fm-droid-afk-askuser-check.sh
#
# Exit/output contract:
#   ALLOW - exit 0 and no output when AFK is inactive or scope is not a primary.
#   DENY  - exit 2, stdout empty, and a Droid-compatible deny object on stderr.
