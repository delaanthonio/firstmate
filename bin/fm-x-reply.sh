# Post firstmate's composed answer back to the relay for a pending X mention.
#
# Usage: fm-x-reply.sh <request_id> <text>
#        fm-x-reply.sh <request_id> --text-file <path>   # read the reply from a file
#        fm-x-reply.sh <request_id> -                    # read the reply from stdin
#
# The --text-file / stdin forms exist so a caller never has to inline reply text
# (which may be influenced by a public mention) into a shell command, where shell
# expansion or quote-breakage could bite. fmx-respond uses them; the positional
# <text> form is kept for back-compat and tests.
#
# POSTs {request_id, text} to $RELAY/connector/answer with the bearer token. The
# relay binds the reply to the exact tweet it recorded for that request_id, so
# this client only ever echoes the relay-issued request_id and NEVER names a
# tweet id. On success it echoes ONLY that request_id; on a non-2xx (or transport
# failure) it exits non-zero so the caller knows the post did not land.
#
# Config (home .env or env): FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN (required), FMX_RELAY_URL
# (default https://myfirstmate.io). Auth: Authorization: Bearer <token>.
#
# Preview / dry-run: with FMX_DRY_RUN set (truthy), the reply is NOT posted.
# Instead the would-be POST body {request_id, text} is recorded to
# state/x-outbox/<request_id>.json and a one-line "DRY RUN" summary is printed to
# stderr; stdout still echoes the request_id and the exit is 0, so the loop runs
# end to end without a public tweet. Dry-run needs neither a token nor the relay.
